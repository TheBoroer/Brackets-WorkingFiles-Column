### Things that need fixing:
- Dragging to re-order working files doesn't work
- Project & Working Files width should be able to be resized separately (right now they're locked to 50% width of the total sidebar width)
- When in vertical/horizontal working file split view, fix the resizing issue for the the two working file sections (locked at 50% total window height)
